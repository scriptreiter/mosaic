This site is a project developed as preparation for my summer internship at WhitePages. It is designed to allow a user to upload an image, which it will create a mosaic for, using publicly available images from flickr. The site will create a database matching images to colors in order to create the mosaics in a timely fashion. Ultimately, it may cycles images through the database scraping flickr regularly.
